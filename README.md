# Human-Computer Interaction Project - 2019
Assessment project for the course "Human-Computer Interactio" of 5th semester, Department of Informatics - University of Piraeus.

In this project, I had to create a ticket reservation system, with WinForms, emphasizing the human-computer interaction instead of fully functionality. That is, keeping things simple and easy to use.
